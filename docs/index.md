# Welcome to the documentation of Geübt-Charak

This is the characterisation module of NRW-GEÜBT.

User uploaded assemblies are processed with the Bakcharak pipeline:

- Serotyping
- Virulence factor predictions
- AMR predictions

While this module can be used on its own, it is recommended to use the Geübt-core application instead.
